        <h2 class="divider">We're really great guys</h2>
        <p>
          We grew up in downtown Chicago, and we used to play in a band. Jake
          loves fried chicken, and Elwood loves dry white toast.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the band didn't make it, the hard work we put in trying to
          promote it sure did. Like a lot of people, we needed a website, and we
          needed to rank. The "experts" didn't seem to know what they were
          talking about, so we figured it out on our own.
        </p>
        <h2 class="divider">We can do all sorts of great stuff</h2>
        <p>
          Honestly most people in this industry seem to be full of crap. We
          don't care what you've heard, or what others have told you, we get
          results and at the end of the day, what else matters?
        </p>
        <p>
          So sure, maybe we're a bit different from what you'd expect, but if
          you want to rank, market, and build your way to the top, we're the
          brothers for you.
